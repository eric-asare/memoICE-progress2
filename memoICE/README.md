MemoICE
----------------------

### DESCRIPTION
MemoICE is a memory game designed to train the brain , increase once's vocabulary and build friendship. Users (two players each) play against time to memorize words shown them. Then write all the words they remember to earn points and a place as a fire breather on the leaderboard. 

MemoICE has easy, medium, difficult and pro levels. Users can select the level and enter the room designed purposely for such level of gaming.

### STEPS COMPLETED
This is the game flow

* Two users  enter their name and join the same room from the lobby or landing page ( There are 4 rooms based on game difficulty : easy, medium, hard, pro levels)

* When a third User Join, he or she is prompted to join another room

* Only one user has to click the start button. Once, the start button is clicked, the client side sends a signal to the server to load the game data ( ideally , words to test users and the timelimit to memorize). 

* Client upon receiving this game data displays to the users and starts the timer. 

* Once the timer is done, a text box appears to the users telling them to enter the words they remember ( Ideally there should be a timer for this as well so that it causes the users to feel a sense of urgency and to make the leader board competitive)

* When users submit a word, the data is sent from the client side to the server side 

* The server upon receiving the wordInput data prepares a progress report to send to client by 1. keeping track of the name of the user who submitted the word, 2. where the word is correct or wrong 3. Score increment and deduction

* The client upon receiving the progress report back displays to the user

* When the remembering phase timer is over, the users are shown their score and position on the leader board and redirected to the lobby. 

### CHALLENGES AND LESSONS
* Keeping Score Board - adding to array in OBJECTS 
* Lots of bugs, solved by running little of the client -server communication as I write


### NEXT STEPS
* Detailed Wireframe
* Improve UI( Needs a color pallete)
* Top 5 players on landing page
* Add Words Shuffler or Generator (API)
* Timer for writing remembered words
* neDB for Score Board
* Functions to clean up code
* Remove unused code
* Ticking Timer Sound
